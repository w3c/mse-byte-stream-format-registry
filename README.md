This repository contains the latest Editor's Draft of the [Media Source Extensions Byte Stream Format Registry](https://w3c.github.io/mse-byte-stream-format-registry) specification, developed by the [Media Working Group](https://www.w3.org/media-wg/).

**Note:** The registry was copied over from the main [Media Source Extensions repository](https://github.com/w3c/media-source) end of September 2020. Please refer to the main repository for the history of changes made to the specification before that date.
